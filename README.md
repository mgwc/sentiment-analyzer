### CIT 595 Spring 2020 -- Homework #4

The link to the description of this assignment is available in the "Homework #4" assignment in Canvas.

### Important notes about submitting your code!

Unlike CIT 593, we will *not* be using Codio for submission and grading for this assignment.

Please do *not* select the "Education -> Mark as Completed" option from the menu; otherwise you won't be able to continue your work!

When you are done with this assignment, download all .cpp and .h files, as well as the Makefile, from Codio and then put them into a single zip file. However, please do *not* submit the boost files or reviews.txt.

Then submit the zip file to the "Homework #4" assignment in Canvas.
